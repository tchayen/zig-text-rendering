# zig-rendering

Basic setup of libraries for:

- WebGPU graphics
- FreeType font rendering with HarfBuzz shaping

Following [zig-gamedev](https://github.com/zig-gamedev/zig-gamedev/tree/main) - I am using its libraries - this project uses Zig 0.13.0-dev.351+64ef45eb0 (locally managing it using [zigup](https://github.com/marler8997/zigup)).

**NOTE:** this is WIP, publishing this repo to gather feedback and opinions but the results are not satisfactory yet.

**NOTE:** for some reason Dawn is crashing a lot on macOS (at least for me). I saw some people having the same issue, I had the same issue in C++ with Dawn, I had it with other Dawn bindings for Zig so it looks like a Dawn issue. I don't have any reliable solution for this â€“ I just developed most of this project on Windows.
